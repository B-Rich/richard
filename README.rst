Richard is a Django project (not a Django app) for video index sites.

It currently has no features. If you're looking at this or using it at this
stage, then you're either a friend of mine or you're intrigued by the
future possibilities.

My priorities:

1. Maximize ease of finding the video you're looking for.
2. Minimize site upkeep and maintenance---it's an index and it should pretty
   much run itself.
3. Minimize work for adding video.

Things I'd like to implement at some point in the future:

* search: terms search for quickly finding things
* navigation: from a given video, easily navigate to related videos on a
  variety of axes like speaker, conference, keywords, ...
* feeds: every listing should have a feed view of it
* Universal Subtitles
* Popcorn.js
* democratizing video metadata upkeep: this is foo-foo speak for making it
  easy for anyone to help maintain the metadata and make it better
